This document provides a brief overview of the tasks that this application performs.

1. **Run through existing code**: The application starts by running through the existing code in the `existing_code.py` file.

2. **Clean up all coding**: The application then cleans up the code by removing any unnecessary lines or comments, and formats it according to the Python PEP 8 style guide. The cleaned code is saved in the `cleaned_code.py` file.

3. **Add any missing files**: The application checks for any missing files that are required to run the code. This is done by the `missing_files.py` file.

4. **Clone the GitHub repository**: Instructions on how to clone the GitHub repository can be found in the `README.md` file. The link to the repository is stored in the `github_repository_link` variable, and the command to clone the repository is stored in the `clone_command` variable.

5. **Run the GitHub repository**: Instructions on how to run the GitHub repository can be found in the `run_instructions.py` file and the `README.md` file. The command to run the repository is stored in the `run_command` variable, and any installation requirements are stored in the `installation_requirements` variable.
